## Event Usage Guidelines

Understanding your event usage helps you choose the right plan:

### Typical Event Volumes

**Small Server (5 - 20 players)**:
- ~50,000 - 200,000 events/month
- **Recommended**: Server plan

**Medium Server (20 - 100 players)**:
- ~200,000 - 1,000,000 events/month
- **Recommended**: Server or Network plan

**Large Server/Network (100+ players)**:
- ~1,000,000+ events/month
- **Recommended**: Network or Enterprise plan

### What Counts as an Event?

Every call to `analytics.track()` counts as one event:

```kotlin
// This is 1 event
analytics.track("player_join", mapOf(
    "player_uuid" to event.player.uniqueId
))

// This is also 1 event
analytics.track("player_command", mapOf(
    "player_uuid" to event.player.uniqueId,
    "command" to "gamemode",
    "args" to "creative"
))
```

Your data retention period determines how long your analytics data is stored:

- **7 days**: Perfect for real-time monitoring and tracking weekly trends
- **30 days**: Track monthly trends and patterns
- **90 days**: Seasonal analysis
- **365 days**: Long-term insights

After your retention period expires, older data is automatically deleted to keep your dashboard fast and to sustain the service.

## User Management

Plans with multiple user support allow you to:

- **Invite team members** to your server dashboard
- **Share analytics insights** across your staff team
- **Collaborate on data analysis** without sharing login credentials
- **Maintain separate access controls** for different team members

<Aside type="tip">

**Network Plan and Above**: Add team members in your server settings under the "Users" section, read [Create a server](guides/create-server#invite-team-members-optional) for more info.
