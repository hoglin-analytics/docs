import { LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Explore page is your command center for analyzing server analytics. It provides two powerful views for examining your event data: a detailed **Table View** for inspecting individual events, and a **Chart View** for visualizing trends over time.

---

## Table View

The Table View displays your events in a structured format, perfect for detailed analysis and debugging.

### Key Features

**Real-time Data**: Events appear automatically as they're tracked from your server

**Event Details**: Each row shows:
- **Timestamp** - When the event occurred (formatted as "Month DD h:mm AM/PM")
- **Event Type** - Color-coded badges for easy identification
- **Properties** - JSON-formatted event data with syntax highlighting

**Smart Filtering**: Use property filters to find exactly what you're looking for

### When to Use Table View

<Aside type="tip">

**Perfect for:**
- Debugging specific events
- Examining detailed property data
- Finding individual player actions
- Validating your tracking implementation

</Aside>

## Chart View

The Chart View transforms your events into interactive time-series visualizations, ideal for spotting trends and patterns.

### Visualization Options

**Event Counting**: By default, charts show the number of events over time

**Property Aggregation**: For numeric properties, you can aggregate data using:
- **Sum** - Add up all values
- **Average** - Calculate the average value
- **Min/Max** - Find minimum or maximum values

### Interactive Features

**Hover Details**: Click any point to see:
- All events in that time period
- Individual event properties
- Aggregated values (when using numeric properties)

### Advanced Filtering

**Event Type Filtering**: Show/hide specific event types to focus your analysis

**Property Filters**: Use the same powerful filtering system as the table view

**Numeric Property Analysis**: Select any numeric property to visualize trends in your custom data

### When to Use Chart View

<Aside type="tip">

**Perfect for:**
- Identifying usage patterns
- Monitoring server activity over time
- Comparing different event types
- Analyzing numeric property trends (like economy data, server performance, etc.)

## Property Filters

Both views support advanced property filtering to narrow down your data.

### Filter Types

| Operator | Symbol | Description | Example |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Equals | `=` | Exact match | `world = "survival"` |
| Not Equals | `!=` | Exclude matches | `player_uuid != "admin-uuid"` |
| Contains | `~` | Partial text match | `command ~ "gamemode"` |
| Greater Than | `>` | Numeric comparison | `score > 100` |
| Less Than | `<` | Numeric comparison | `health < 5` |
| Greater/Equal | `≥` | Numeric comparison | `level >= 10` |
| Less/Equal | `≤` | Numeric comparison | `hunger <= 3` |

### Creating Filters

1. **Select Property** - Choose from available property keys
2. **Pick Operator** - Select how to compare the value
3. **Enter Value** - Type the value to filter by
4. **Add Filter** - Click "Add" or press Enter

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Example Filters">
    ```
    world = "creative"           # Events in creative world
    command ~ "tp"               # Commands containing "tp"
    damage > 5                   # High damage events
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Best Practices

### For Table View
- Use property filters to reduce noise when debugging
- Look for patterns in the JSON properties to optimize your tracking

### For Chart View
- Start with all event types, then filter to focus on specific patterns
- Use numeric property aggregation to track custom metrics
- Compare multiple event types to understand user behavior flows

### General Tips
- **Combine Both Views**: Use charts to spot trends, then switch to table view to examine specific events
- **Filter Strategically**: Start broad, then narrow down with property filters
- **Monitor Real-time**: Both views update automatically as new events arrive
