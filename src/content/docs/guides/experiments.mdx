title: Experiments
description: Control features on your Minecraft server with progressive rollouts, allowlists, and more.

import { Tabs, TabItem, Steps, Aside, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Hoglin Experiments let you **control features and test changes** on your Minecraft server, without code changes or restarts. Use them to roll out new features, run testing, or enable features for specific players.

---

## What Are Experiments?

Experiments are toggles you can use to:

- Gradually enable new features for a percentage of your players
- Instantly turn features on or off from your dashboard
- Allow specific players (like staff or testers) to always see a feature
- Test changes safely before rolling out to everyone

<Aside type="tip">
**No restarts required:** Experiments update instantly - no need to reload or restart your server.
</Aside>

---

## How Experiments Work

Each experiment has:

- **Experiment ID**: A unique key (e.g. `new_shop_ui`)
- **Name & Description**: For easy identification
- **Enabled / Disabled**: Instantly turn features on or off
- **Rollout Percentage**: Gradually enable for a % of players
- **Allowlist**: Always include specific player UUIDs

When you check an experiment in your plugin, Hoglin uses a deterministic algorithm to decide if a player is included, based on the rollout percentage and allowlist.

---

## Creating an Experiment

<Steps>
1. ### Go to the Experiments tab

   In your [Hoglin dashboard](https://hoglin.gg/dashboard), click **Experiments**.

2. ### Click "Create Experiment"

   Fill in:
   - **Experiment ID**: Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens/underscores (e.g. `new_shop_ui`)
   - **Name**: Human-readable name (e.g. "New Shop UI")
   - **Description**: (Optional) What this experiment controls

3. ### Set rollout and enable

   - Use the slider to set the **rollout percentage** (e.g. 10% for a small test)
   - Toggle **Enabled** to activate the experiment

4. ### Save

   Your experiment is now live! You can edit, disable, or delete it anytime.
</Steps>

## Using Experiments in Your Plugin

Check if a player is included in an experiment before showing a feature:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    // Asynchronous check (recommended)
    hoglin.hasExperiment("new_shop_ui", player.uniqueId) { inExperiment ->
        if (inExperiment) {
            // Show new UI
        } else {
            // Show old UI
        }
    }

    // Synchronous check (blocks thread - use sparingly)
    val inExperiment = hoglin.hasExperimentSync("new_shop_ui", player.uniqueId)
    if (inExperiment) {
        // Show new UI
    } else {
        // Show old UI
    }

    // For non-player-specific experiments (server-wide features)
    hoglin.hasExperiment("holiday_event") { isEnabled ->
        if (isEnabled) {
            // Enable holiday decorations
        }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Java">
    ```java
    // Asynchronous check (recommended)
    hoglin.hasExperiment("new_shop_ui", player.getUniqueId(), inExperiment -> {
        if (inExperiment) {
            // Show new UI
        } else {
            // Show old UI
        }
    });

    // Synchronous check (blocks thread - use sparingly)
    boolean inExperiment = hoglin.hasExperimentSync("new_shop_ui", player.getUniqueId());
    if (inExperiment) {
        // Show new UI
    } else {
        // Show old UI
    }

    // For non-player-specific experiments (server-wide features)
    hoglin.hasExperiment("holiday_event", isEnabled -> {
        if (isEnabled) {
            // Enable holiday decorations
        }
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="caution">
**Performance Note:** Use the asynchronous `hasExperiment()` method when possible. The synchronous `hasExperimentSync()` method blocks the current thread and should only be used when you must have the result immediately.

## Advanced Usage Examples

### Checking Experiments in Event Listeners

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    @EventHandler
    fun onPlayerJoin(event: PlayerJoinEvent) {
        val player = event.player

        // Check if player should see welcome message experiment
        hoglin.hasExperiment("new_welcome_message", player.uniqueId) { inExperiment ->
            if (inExperiment) {
                player.sendMessage("Welcome to the server! Check out our new features!")
            } else {
                player.sendMessage("Welcome to the server!")
            }
        }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Java">
    ```java
    @EventHandler
    public void onPlayerJoin(PlayerJoinEvent event) {
        Player player = event.getPlayer();

        // Check if player should see welcome message experiment
        hoglin.hasExperiment("new_welcome_message", player.getUniqueId(), inExperiment -> {
            if (inExperiment) {
                player.sendMessage("Welcome to the server! Check out our new features!");
            } else {
                player.sendMessage("Welcome to the server!");
            }
        });
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Combining Experiments with Analytics

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    // Track when players interact with experimental features
    hoglin.hasExperiment("new_shop_ui", player.uniqueId) { inExperiment ->
        if (inExperiment) {
            // Show new UI
            openNewShopUI(player)

            // Track that they saw the new UI
            hoglin.track("shop_ui_shown", mapOf(
                "ui_version" to "new",
                "player_uuid" to player.uniqueId.toString()
            ))
        } else {
            // Show old UI
            openOldShopUI(player)

            // Track that they saw the old UI
            hoglin.track("shop_ui_shown", mapOf(
                "ui_version" to "old",
                "player_uuid" to player.uniqueId.toString()
            ))
        }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Java">
    ```java
    // Track when players interact with experimental features
    Map<String, Object> properties = new HashMap<>();

    hoglin.hasExperiment("new_shop_ui", player.getUniqueId(), inExperiment -> {
        if (inExperiment) {
            // Show new UI
            openNewShopUI(player);

            // Track that they saw the new UI
            properties.put("ui_version", "new");
            properties.put("player_uuid", player.getUniqueId().toString());
            hoglin.track("shop_ui_shown", properties);
        } else {
            // Show old UI
            openOldShopUI(player);

            // Track that they saw the old UI
            properties.put("ui_version", "old");
            properties.put("player_uuid", player.getUniqueId().toString());
            hoglin.track("shop_ui_shown", properties);
        }
    });
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Rollout Strategies

- **0%**: No one (except allowlist) sees the feature
- **10%**: 10% of players (plus allowlist) see the feature
- **100%**: Everyone sees the feature
- **Allowlist**: Always include specific players (great for staff or small testing)

You can adjust the rollout percentage at any time, changes take effect instantly.

---

## Testing Experiments

You can test if a specific player is included in an experiment:

1. Go to the experiment details page in your dashboard
2. Enter a player UUID in the **Test Experiment** box
3. See if they would be included, based on current settings

---

## Example Use Cases

- **Beta Features:** Roll out a new feature to 5% of players, then increase as you gain confidence
- **Staff Testing:** Add staff UUIDs to the allowlist so they always see new features
- **A/B Testing:** Compare player behavior with and without a feature enabled

---

## API Reference

You can also check experiment status via the API, in case you don't want to use the Hoglin SDK.

```http
GET https://api.hoglin.gg/experiments/{serverKey}/{experimentId}/evaluate?playerUUID={uuid}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "inExperiment": true
}
```

---

## Best Practices

- **Use clear experiment IDs** (e.g. `new_shop_ui`, `holiday_event`)
- **Start with a small rollout** (e.g. 5-10%) and monitor for issues
- **Always test with staff / allowlist before public rollout**
- **Prefer asynchronous calls** to avoid blocking your server's main thread

## FAQ

**Do I need to restart my server to update experiments?**

No! Changes are instant.

**Can I use experiments for A/B testing?**

Yes, just check the experiment in your code and track player behavior as usual.

**What happens if I delete an experiment?**

Deleted experiments return `false` when checked via the SDK.

**Should I use the sync or async methods?**

Use the asynchronous methods (`hasExperiment`) whenever possible to avoid blocking your server. Only use `hasExperimentSync` when you absolutely need the result immediately.

**What happens if the Hoglin API is down?**

The SDK will return `false` for experiment checks. Make sure your code handles this gracefully by having sensible defaults.
