**Hoglin is analytics, reimagined for Minecraft.**

Track player activity, monitor server health, and build your own custom events, all with a privacy-first, developer-friendly SDK.

## Why Analytics for Minecraft?

With Hoglin, you can:

- **Understand your players**: See who's joining, leaving and more.
- **Monitor your server**: Track TPS, memory and other vital stats specific to your server.
- **Make better decisons**: Track what you want to see what players are engaging in, and what they're not.

## What you'll like about Hoglin

- **Custom Event Tracking**: Track *anything* you want, place the `track` method anywhere and add any metadata you want.
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Instantly visualize your data from your server
- **Privacy First**: Hoglin sends no analytics on your behalf, only send what you *want* to send.
- **Easy Integration**: Hoglin is platform agnostic, this means it works from Paper plugins made in Kotlin, down to Java server mods written for Fabric
- **Scaleable**: Hoglin handles anything from small hobbyist projects, to massive networks.

## How it works

1. [**Add the SDK**](/getting-started#install-the-sdk) into your plugin
2. [**Track events**](/guides/player-events) with a single line of code
3. [**View your data**](/guides/explore) instantly in the Hoglin dashboard.
