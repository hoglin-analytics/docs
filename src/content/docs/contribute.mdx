We welcome code contributions from the community, and we thank anyone who takes the time to help improve Hoglin. Currently, we maintain these open-source repositories:
- [Hoglin SDK](https://github.com/WaypointStudios/hoglin-sdk) - Our java SDK for interacting with Hoglin
- [Hoglin PlayerTracker](https://github.com/WaypointStudios/hoglin-player-tracker) - Our public plugin to track various player analytics and serve as an example of SDK usage
- [Hoglin Docs](https://github.com/WaypointStudios/waypoint-hoglin-docs/) - Our documentation site (you are here!)

If you're interested in contributing, create a fork of the repository you'd like to contribute to, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
If your proposed changes are particularly large, please reach out to discuss the viability of your ideas before investing significant time in them.
You can do that through a GitHub issue or by bringing it up in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/waypointstudios).

After submitting a pull request, please be patient as maintainers review your changes. We may request changes or provide feedback before merging.
Please ensure your contributions adhere to the project's existing standards, including code style, testing, and documentation.
