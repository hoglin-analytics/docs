There's a variety of ways to track custom analytics within the Hoglin SDK. This guide will provide an overview of the
different methods available, along with linking to more detailed examples. It will also explain how events are cached
and when they are sent to Hoglin.

<br/>

### The Event Queue
It's important to understand how the SDK caches events on the clientside before they're sent up to the Hoglin.

By default, all tracked events will be added to a queue that gets
flushed periodically; this is referred to as "auto-flushing".

The frequency that Hoglin auto-flushes is set to 15000 ms by
default. The frequency can be controlled by setting `autoFlushInterval` in the
SDK builder to the expected interval in milliseconds.

When auto-flushing, the first `n` events are taken from the queue and
sent to Hoglin, where `n` is the `maxBatchSize` set in the SDK
builder. If there are more events in the queue, they will remain there
until the next flush.

Auto-flushing is asynchronous by default and remains platform-agnostic
by not hooking into platform-specific schedulers, instead we create
our own scheduled thread pool with 8 virtual threads. The executor
used can be manually overridden with the `executor` parameter in the
SDK builder.

<br/>

### Using your own flushing strategy
If you'd like, you can bypass our autoflush strategy and implement your own flushing logic. To do this, set
`enableAutoFlush` to `false` in the SDK builder. Events will still be cached locally, but you can control when they are
sent to Hoglin. To manually flush the queue, call `Hoglin#flush`. This will send *all* cached events to Hoglin,
regardless of the size of the queue. Manual flush calls are **not made asynchronously**.

### Special event parameters
Event parameters with certain names may be treated specially for better integration with the Hoglin dashboard. These
are outlined below:

| Parameter Name | Special Treatment                                                                                            |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `playerUUID`   | Render player name where applicable, eg: "Tracked \{event_name}" -> "\{player name} triggered \{event_name}" |

## Tracking methods
Once you have your [Hoglin instance](/developer-sdk/creating-your-instance/), you'll notice you have a couple overloads
for `Hoglin#track`. To remain flexible, we support a variety of inputs here, differing in complexity and features.
