There's a variety of ways to track custom analytics within the Hoglin SDK. This guide will provide an overview of the
different methods available, along with linking to more detailed examples. It will also explain how events are cached
and when they are sent to Hoglin.

<br/>

### The event queue
It's important to understand how the SDK caches events on the clientside before they're sent up to the Hoglin. By
default, all tracked events will be added to a queue that gets flushed periodically; we call this an "autoflush". The
flush period is defined by `autoFlushInterval` in the SDK builder. When the auto-flushing, the first `n` events are
taken and sent to Hoglin, where `n` is the `maxBatchSize` set in the SDK builder. If there are more events in the queue,
they will remain there until the next flush. Additionally, auto-flushing is asynchronous by default, we create a
scheduled thread pool with 8 virtual threads. This can be manually overridden with the `executor` parameter in the SDK
builder.

<br/>

### Using your own flushing strategy
If you'd like, you can bypass our autoflush strategy and implement your own flushing logic. To do this, set
`enableAutoFlush` to `false` in the SDK builder. Events will still be cached locally, but you can control when they are
sent to Hoglin. To manually flush the queue, call `Hoglin#flush`. This will send *all* cached events to Hoglin,
regardless of the size of the queue. Manual flush calls are **not made asynchronously**.

# Tracking methods
Once you have your [Hoglin instance](/developer-sdk/creating-your-instance/), you'll notice you have a couple overloads
for Hoglin#track. To remain flexible, we support a variety of inputs here, differing in complexity and features.
