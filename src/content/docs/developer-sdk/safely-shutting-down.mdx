title: "Safely Shutting Down the SDK"
description: "Learn how to safely shut down the Hoglin SDK to ensure all events are processed and resources are released."

import {Tabs, TabItem} from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

It's important to make sure we properly shut down the Hoglin SDK when it's no longer needed, this frees up resources and
ensures that all events still in the queue are processed and sent to Hoglin (if possible). We provide a helper
method to do this, `Hoglin#close`, which will **block the thread** until all queued events are sent to Hoglin.
After shutting down, any resources being used by the SDK will be released and so the SDK instance will no longer usable.
If you would like to continue using the SDK after shutdown, a new instance should be created.

## Shutting down the SDK
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Java" icon="seti:java">
```java
Hoglin hoglin = /** Your Hoglin instance */;
hoglin.close();
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Kotlin" icon="seti:kotlin">
```kotlin
val hoglin: Hoglin = /* Your Hoglin instance */
hoglin.close()
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
In the case of something like a Minecraft plugin, the most ideal place to call this would be on the `onDisable()`

## Handling failed flushes on shutdown
In the case of a network failure, Hoglin backend failure, or if your usage quota is full, the SDK may not be able to
push all queued events on shutdown. It will retry 5 times with 5 second delays before failing and continuing. In the
case of failure, the reason will be logged in the console, and the blocking call will be interrupted. Any remaining
events will be lost. If you would like to handle this differently, you may choose to use `Hoglin#flush` before your
`Hoglin#close` call. This executes is a manual flush that will attempt to send all queued events to Hoglin. This method
is also blocking, and returns a `HttpResponse` object, allowing you to handle any error if the flush fails.
