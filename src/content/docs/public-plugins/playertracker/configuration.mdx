Getting started with the PlayerTracker plugin is straightforward, here we'll cover the configuration options available
to you.

<br/>

<Aside type="tip" title="Before You Start">
    - **Create your Hoglin server**: If you haven't already, follow the [Create a Hoglin Server](/guides/create-hoglin-server) guide.
    - **Have your API Key ready**: You can find your api key in the Hoglin dashboard under **Settings** > **API Info** > **API Key**.
</Aside>

<br/>

## The configuration file
Once you start your server, the PlayerTracker plugin will automatically create a default configuration file at
`plugins/PlayerTracker/hoglin.toml`. An example of the default configuration can be found below:

```toml
[authentication]
server_key = "" # Your server key can be found on the settings panel of your Hoglin server

[auto_flush] # An auto flush perioidcally pushes a batch of cached analytics from the server to Hoglin
interval = 15000 # Interval in milliseconds to push events to Hoglin
max_batch_size = 10000 # Maximum number to send in a single batch
```

There are descriptions of each field; all you need to get started is to fill in the `server_key` field with your API
Key. You may also choose to modify the other fields should they interest you, but the defaults are generally sufficient.

<br/>

## Reloading the configuration
To reload the configuration file after making changes, you can use the `/playertracker reload` command in-game or from the
console. If anything goes wrong, an error message will be displayed in the console, and Hoglin will not function until
re-reloaded with a correct config. Alternatively, you can restart the server to apply changes.

## Logging purchases
The PlayerTracker plugin provides a command to track purchases from a payment platform, eg: Tebex. To log a purchase,
make sure you've set up your platform to execute this command when a purchase is made:

`/playertracker purchase <player_uuid> <purchase_value> <product_name>`

The last argument (product name) takes in multiple words. Example: `/playertracker purchase 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000 9.99 VIP Rank`.
This will track the purchase in Hoglin, allowing you to visualize transactions in the dashboard.
