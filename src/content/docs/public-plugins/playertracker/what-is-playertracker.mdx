PlayerTracker is a plugin for Paper 1.21.x+ servers that serves as an introduction to Hoglin.
It collects various common player metrics and hooks into several plugins when possible to provide extra data.
It is designed to be easy to install and use, with minimal configuration required to get started.
It's also [open-sourced](https://github.com/WaypointStudios/hoglin-player-tracker/), providing examples of how to use
the Hoglin SDK as a developer.

To get started with PlayerTracker, visit the [installation guide](/public-plugins/playertracker/installation). For a
detailed rundown of features, see below:

### `player_join`
Recorded when a player joins the server.

| Parameter        | Type     | Description                                                                     |
|------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `uuid`           | `UUID`   | The UUID of the player who joined                                               |
| `hostname`       | `String` | The hostname used by the player to connect to the server, eg "play.example.com" |
| `ip`             | `String` | The IP address of the player                                                    |
| `clientPlatform` | `String` | The platform the player is using, eg "JAVA" or "BEDROCK"                        |
| `clientVersion`  | `String` | The client version used by the player, eg "1.21.1"                              |
| `clientBrand`    | `String` | The client brand used by the player, eg "Vanilla" or "Fabric"                   |

<Aside type="note" title="A note on client platform">
    We hook into GeyserMC to determine if the player is on Bedrock.
    If GeyserMC is not installed, the `clientPlatform` parameter will just always be "JAVA"
</Aside>
<Aside type="note" title="A note on client version">
    The client version is determined by [PacketEvents](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents/). ViaVersion will work
    fine, some other solutions may also work.
    Notably, due to Minecraft limitations, not all versions can be differentiated - eg: 1.21.7 and 1.21.8 will both be
    reported as "1.21.7".
    This is because the Minecraft protocol version doesn't change between some versions, so there's no way to tell them
    apart.
    In practice, this doesn't matter much, but it's worth noting to prevent confusion. A full list of protocol versions
    can be found [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Projects/wiki.vg_merge/Protocol_version_numbers).
